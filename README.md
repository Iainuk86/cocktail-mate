# cocktail-mate
App to browse cocktails with their recipes for some weekend (or weekday, no judgement) inspiration.

Back-end was built using Spring Boot using several dependencies, one of which was Spring Boot Data JPA to connect to a MySQL database.

The front-end was created using the Thymeleaf template engine with the use of Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript functionality.
The current look of the app is temporary and will be revisited once I have begun to learn Angular.
